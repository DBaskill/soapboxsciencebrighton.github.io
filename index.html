<p>Soapbox Science is a public outreach platform that promotes women scientists and the science they do. Events are hosted in the UK and across the world to celebrate women in STEMM, breaking down barriers and challenging stereotypes about who a STEMM researcher is.</p>

<p>The Brighton event, now in its sixth year, is organised by a group of staff at the University of Sussex and is part of the festival Brighton Fringe.</p>

<p>Dr Beth Nicholls, Research Fellow in the School of Life Sciences and lead event organiser, said: “Like so many other events, last year we had to go virtual with Soapbox Science. However, we are really hoping the 2022 event can be held in-person at our usual spot on Brighton seafront. Soapbox Science offers a great opportunity for scientists at all levels – from PhD to Professor – to get some experience sharing their research to members of the public in a fun, accessible format. It’s a great day!”.</p>
